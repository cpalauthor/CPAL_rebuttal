## Results on 4 hidden layered network

![](L4.pdf)

The performance increase by weight correlation (in this case, $m=50$ vs $m=0$) is more pronounced in deeper networks (in this case, $L=4$).
This leads to a consistent amount of improvement by weight correlation across the number of training samples tested (from $P=128$ to $P=4096$).
